        <p>The impact of technology on the world:between progress and challenges 

            Technology has become a hallmark of modern life, accompanied by a set of pros and cons
            
            The pros 
            1.developing productivity and efficiency:
            
            Technology is a major driver for improving and developing efficiency in various fields, whether in industrial productivity or administrative work, which leads to increased production.
            
            2 .improving health care and medicine:
            
            The technology contributed to a great development in the field of medicine, through robotic surgery and medical imaging, which led to the development of patient care and disease diagnosis .
            3: increasing the vision of knowledge:
            
            Information has become available to everyone online, helping to increase the visibility of knowledge, expand its horizon and facilitate access to a variety of sources. Technology also provides advanced learning opportunities through the Internet, as well as improving means of communication and communication.
            
            The cons
            1.Environmental impact:
            
            Technological development is accompanied by negative effects, for example, e-waste and energy consumption, which poses difficulties to preserve the environment.
            
            The industry has also led to carbon dioxide pollution of the air leading to human disease. On the other hand, industrial liquid waste is the most dangerous water pollutant in the whole world, as most of the toxic pollutants found in water come from agricultural activities.
            2.deterioration of health 
            
            Technology has contributed to the deterioration of the health of living organisms, especially humans, starting with air and water pollution. As well as the bad use of electronic devices, which are harmful to the cells in the body. Which led to the tension and nervousness that became one of the basic qualities of modern humans.
            
            _ finally,the effectiveness of modern technology lies in the balance between dealing with its challenges and exploiting its benefits, with a focus on socialÂ progress.</p>
